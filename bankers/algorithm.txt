1. Start

2. Define a structure "bankers" to hold the necessary variables and arrays.

3. Define functions to initialize the structure, input data, implement the Banker's algorithm, search for safe processes, and display the results.

4. In the bankers_init function:
   - Set the initial values of variables and arrays in the structure.

5. In the bankers_input function:
   - Prompt the user to enter the number of processes and resources.
   - Read the allocated resources for each process and calculate the needed resources.
   - Read the currently available resources in the system.

6. In the bankers_method function:
   - Initialize the iteration variable i to 0.
   - Start an infinite loop.
   - Check if the process at index i is not finished.
   - Call the bankers_search function to check if the process can be executed.
   - If the process can be executed:
     - Add the process to the result array and mark it as finished.
     - Update the available resources.
   - Increment i.
   - If i reaches the number of processes:
     - Check if the available resources have not changed.
     - Update the work array with the current available resources.
     - If the available resources have not changed, break the loop.
     - Otherwise, reset i to 0 and continue the loop.

7. In the bankers_search function:
   - Iterate through the needed resources of the process at index i.
   - If any of the needed resources is greater than the available resources, return -1.
   - Otherwise, return 0.

8. In the bankers_display function:
   - Display the allocated, maximum, and needed resources for each process.
   - Display the sequence of safe processes.
   - Display the sequence of unsafe processes.
   - Display the result indicating if the system is in a safe state or deadlock may occur.

9. In the main function:
   - Print a title for the program.
   - Create an instance of the bankers structure.
   - Call the bankers_init function to initialize the structure.
   - Call the bankers_input function to input the necessary data.
   - Call the bankers_method function to implement the Banker's algorithm.
   - Call the bankers_display function to display the results.

10. End
